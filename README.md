This is where I will upload any projects I do in Python!

FF14_RedMage_RotationTest.py:
This Python script uses the libraries: Random, Time, and Keyboard. It allows you to use the main abilities of Red Mage at level 90 from the popular MMO Final Fantasy 14. The program allows you to test yourself at doing the level 90 rotation. Due to damage calculations still being a bit of a mystery in FF14, it can not allow you to check your damage per second. Another issue is allowing inputs while waiting for a timer to tic down, because of that you need to hold down the key of an off global coooldown ability to be able to cast it during a timer of a hard casted ability. By changing the input variables you can set the abilities to be bound to any keys on your keyboard.

View in Chat Discord Bot:
When sending links in Discord from some sites, like Twitter or Tiktok, the video or image wont load or be able to be played in the Discord chat unless you add 2 letters before the website name in the URL. What this bot does is it deletes a message from a user if it has a link from one of those sites without the 2 letters and resend the message with the links having the letters so users can view the content without clicking the link.
