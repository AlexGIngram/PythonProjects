This is where I will upload any projects I do in Python!

FF14_RedMage_RotationTest.py:
This Python script uses the libraries: Random, Time, and Keyboard. It allows you to use the main abilities of Red Mage at level 90 from the popular MMO Final Fantasy 14. The program allows you to test yourself at doing the level 90 rotation. Due to damage calculations still being a bit of a mystery in FF14, it can not allow you to check your damage per second. Another issue is allowing inputs while waiting for a timer to tic down, because of that you need to hold down the key of an off global coooldown ability to be able to cast it during a timer of a hard casted ability. By changing the input variables you can set the abilities to be bound to any keys on your keyboard.
